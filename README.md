Data Science Projects

## [Project 1: Prison breaks: Project Overview](https://github.com/NourKhawaled/Nour_Portfolio-/blob/main/Project_1.ipynb)
* Obtain real data from the internet and prepare it for analysis.
* In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
* In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?

## [Project 2: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets: Project Overview](https://github.com/NourKhawaled/Nour_Portfolio-/blob/main/Project_2.ipynb)
* Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and the App Store.

## [Project 3: Exploring Hacker News Posts: Project Overview](https://github.com/NourKhawaled/Nour_Portfolio-/blob/main/Project_3_Hacker_News.ipynb)
* In this project, we want to analyze Hacker News site data.
* Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit.
* We're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
* We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
  1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
  2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
